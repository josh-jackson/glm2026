You will give it a shot, and then as a class we’ll come back and work through each part.\nThose of you who took the Applied Statistical Analysis with R class might remember this dataset from your final project. These are data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), however they have been pared down to make it a little more cohesive. Let’s get going.\nEveryone needs to import the dataset. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh-jackson/glm2026/refs/heads/main/hcp-data.csv\ntest\n\n\nGet the mean and standard deviation of the Card Sorting task, PMAT 24 task, and List Sorting task per combination of age category and gender category. Use tidyverse so that you are not calculating all of these manually.\n\n\n\nMake the following 3 figures on any of the variables of your choosing (they do not have to be the same variable(s) per figure):\n\nOverlapping density distribution 1 variable per level of a categorical variable\nScatter plot with a best fit line\nA combination of violin plot and box plot (raw dat points optional)\n\nAll figures must have axes lables that are not the original variable name (aka, make them more readable). Colors should be chosen by you and not the default colors. You must change the theme in at least 1 of the 3 figures.\n\n\n\nTo calculate a correlation by hand, the formula looks like this: \\[ \\frac{\\Sigma z_x z_y}{n-1}\\]\nThat is, you take the \\(z\\)-scores of variable \\(x\\) times the \\(z\\)-scores of variable \\(y\\), and add up those cross products. Then divide that sum of cross products by \\(n-1\\). Pick 2 variables and do this for yourself. After, use the \\(cor\\) function to see if your hand calculation matches the function’s calculation."

The two factors are: 1) Publisher, which has two levels (DC or Marvel comics). 2) is Alignment, which has three levels (good, bad, neutral). The DV is Total, which is a combination of strength, intelligence, speed, durability, power, and combat. Higher scores are better.\nThe research question is whether there are differences in total across publisher, across type of superhereo alignment and whether there is an interaction between these two factors. Data can be found here: hw-6-data.csv\nRemember that if you work with a peer or use AI tools like Chat-GPT, you must cite them in your code.\nYou will submit both your .Rmd/.qmd and HTML files to Canvas. For all figures, you must be intentional. Change the axes names, the theme etc. Do not settle for the defaults!\nGood luck!\n\nWrite the equation that you will use to test the hypothesis.
